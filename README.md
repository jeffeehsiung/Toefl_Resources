# Toefl_Resources
The repository contains my referenced 📚 for TOEFL IBT test. By going over the materials at least once and within 2 weeks, I achieved an okay score of 109 (Reading 30, Listening 30, Speaking 25, Writing 24). Hopefully the attached materials will help you achieve one that's even better than mine. Please 👍 / ⭐️ repository if you find it useful. 🙏🏻
